# 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Lee

I'm a **computational biologist** and **data scientist** with a background in **molecular biology**, **bioinformatics**, and **data engineering**. I’m passionate about building tools and workflows that make biological data more accessible, interoperable, and actionable — especially in the context of **translational research**, **precision medicine**, and **drug discovery**.

---

## 🧬 What I Do

I combine experimental insight with software engineering and analytics to solve problems at the interface of **biology and data**. My work often involves:

- Designing scalable data models for biomedical repositories (FAIR-compliant)
- Curating multi-omics datasets for public release
- Building dashboards, ETL pipelines, and database systems
- Collaborating across disciplines to move discoveries from **bench to bedside**

---

## 🚀 Mission & Motivation

I’m driven by the opportunity to **accelerate research** through better infrastructure and smarter tools. I believe well-designed data systems can transform how we share findings, replicate experiments, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

---

## 🔍 Looking Ahead

I’m currently exploring opportunities that blend:

- **Bioinformatics & AI**  
- **Computational drug development**  
- **Open science infrastructure**  
- **Clinical data modeling & real-world evidence**

I'm also preparing for **PhD programs** that focus on **translational bioinformatics** and **precision health**, particularly in the UC and Stanford systems.
